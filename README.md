# Added Tools

## Gems
### haml-rails
Clean Template Engine, mostly useful for forcing all developers to write clean legible code.
Also prevents Ruby HTML structure-errors as encapsulation is handled by indentation-level and not Closing Tags or end-statements.

### rubyzip and zip-zip
Use your preferred tool for zipping files. Useful for multi-file downloads as a single request can only yield a single file-download.

### andand
Clean up your code with "andand" rather than expression && expression.method

### aws-sdk-3 gems
Enable deployment to AWS, my preferred hosting solution

### activerecord-import
To be outdated in Rails 6 by built-in functions, but the best approach in Rails 5 to mass-insertion and updating.

### jquery gems
Easily incorporate JQuery and JQuery-UI CSS and Javascripts

### bootstrap_form, country_select, and bootstrap3_autocomplete_input
Easily generate Bootstrap-styled forms and country-select fields

### simple_form
Easily generate forms, automatically in Bootstrap styling. This is fully installed so forms generated by "rails scaffold ..." should be in simple_form format.

### browser
Browser-and-device detection. This is used in layouts/footer to add padding for iphone users so that content at the bottom of the page is not covered by the iphone interface.

### time_difference
Enables easy arithmetic with times. Note: This gives absolute values of differences between times given.

### order_as_specified
Allows you to use an array to set a specific order for elements in a relation. Used in self.order_by_presence, which is defined for all models and allows ordering by value of a Boolean with user-controlled null-handling.

### paper_trail
Uses a "Version" table to maintain a full changelog of all records in models with this Gem enabled. Vital for any auditable records.

### wicked_pdf and wkhtmltopdf-binary
Enables pdf-generation and automatically installs required binary

### timezone
Get timezone information for given locations and datetimes, adjusting for EST / EDT and other such issues.

### que
Enables ActiveJob queueing through the Postgres database rather than require Redis or some other tool. It is best to minimize the number of different parts of cloud-infrastructure.

### meta-tags
Enables easy SEO. This is used in controllers/concerns/seo.rb to set all SEO meta-tags and control appearance in Facebook and Twitter sharing. Tags can also be changed page-by-page as needed. Tags are set to be displayed in application.html.erb.
